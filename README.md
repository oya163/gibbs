These are the outcomes of my learning during my internship in [NAAMII](https://www.naamii.com.np/).
I wrote couple of scripts for finite and infinite mixture models based on Chinese Restaurant Process.
I have shown usage of various conjugate priors and also collapsed sampling methods.

I worked along with Sushil Awale to implement unsupervised monolingual word segmentation based on [goldwater-etal-2006-contextual](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P06-1085/)
and [snyder-barzilay-2008-unsupervised](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P08-1084/). We came up with monolingual word segmentation with beta-geometric conjugate prior over the length of a given word.

## Tasks-to-do
